  #  Agro-Industry LATAM summit 2021

This project is for a website/webapp that will be used to display the information of the "Agro-Industry LATAM summit 2021". Notice that the webinar *NOT* real. in order to do so, we used the template design that is provided by Cindy Shin. On this capstone we wont finish the all page but only the landing page and the about page. This will be done for both mobile and desktop screen sizes. Also we implement some features that are built with JavaScript vanilla flavor as well as BootStrap5 for styling the pages.
